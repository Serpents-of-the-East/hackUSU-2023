Rescue Hara, the Stuffed Bunny
"Excuse me, young adventurer. I am in need of your assistance. My precious stuffed rabbit, Hana, has been stolen from the local rocks. She was a gift from my beloved wife, who has since passed away, and holds great sentimental value to me. I fear that if I do not recover her soon, she may be lost forever." He pauses, his eyes brimming with tears, and then continues. "I am too old and weak to go searching for her myself. Please, will you help me find Hana and return her to me?" You nod in agreement, moved by the old samurai's tale. He gives you a grateful smile and hands you a small, tattered map that he says will lead you to the rocks where Hana was last seen. With a bow, you set off on your quest.
